## Scripts written for related tasks at work. 

Everything being put in here is things that have been written to perform tasks at work, typically in either RHEL 7 or RHEL 8 environments. The systems commonly were DISA STIG compliant, and running SELinux.

All of the README.txt files that are seperate from the scripts (if I wrote one for them) have been included in the scripts as comments.
